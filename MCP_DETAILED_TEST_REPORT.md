# Arkavo MCP Server Test Report - Detailed Analysis

## Summary

This report provides a detailed analysis of the Arkavo MCP server tools, expanding on the initial findings in `MCP_TEST_REPORT.md`. The tests were conducted on **June 27, 2025**, using the booted simulator with UDID `F1EB6D6F-D828-494C-A96B-E50816E0DA43`.

The following tools have been identified as returning false success responses, indicating a lack of proper input validation and error handling. This can lead to silent failures and unreliable automation.

## Critical Issues: Tools with False Success Responses

### 1. **mutate_state** ⚠️
- **Issue**: The tool consistently returns `{"success": true}` even when provided with invalid `entity` and `action` parameters that do not correspond to any valid state or operation in the system.
- **Test Command**: `mutate_state(entity="invalid_entity", action="invalid_action")`
- **Actual Result**: `{"success": true, "result": {"last_action": "invalid_action", ...}}`
- **Expected Result**: The tool should return an error indicating that the entity or action is not valid. For example: `{"success": false, "error": "Invalid entity or action provided."}`
- **Impact**: High. This makes it impossible to determine if a state mutation has actually occurred, leading to unpredictable application states and test failures.

### 2. **passkey_dialog** ⚠️
- **Issue**: The tool returns a success message even when no passkey dialog is present on the screen. It does not verify the presence of a dialog before attempting to interact with it.
- **Test Command**: `passkey_dialog(action="dismiss_enrollment_warning", device_id="F1EB6D6F-D828-494C-A96B-E50816E0DA43")`
- **Actual Result**: `{"success": true, "message": "Attempted to dismiss passkey enrollment warning using ESC key"}`
- **Expected Result**: The tool should first check for the presence of the dialog and return an error if it is not found. For example: `{"success": false, "error": "Passkey enrollment dialog not found."}`
- **Impact**: Medium. This can cause tests to proceed under the false assumption that a dialog was handled, leading to subsequent steps failing.

### 3. **intelligent_bug_finder** ⚠️
- **Issue**: The tool returns a list of hardcoded, mock bug data regardless of the validity or content of the specified `module`. The returned bugs are not related to the actual code.
- **Test Command**: `intelligent_bug_finder(module="AuthenticationManager")`
- **Actual Result**: A list of generic bugs related to `payment_service.rs` and `api_client.rs`.
- **Expected Result**: The tool should analyze the specified module and return relevant potential bugs, or an empty list if none are found.
- **Impact**: High. The tool is currently unusable for its intended purpose.

### 4. **discover_invariants** ⚠️
- **Issue**: The tool returns generic, hardcoded invariants that are not specific to the provided `system`. The same invariants are returned for any input.
- **Test Command**: `discover_invariants(system="user_authentication")`
- **Actual Result**: Invariants related to user balance and payment idempotency.
- **Expected Result**: The tool should analyze the specified system and return invariants that are relevant to it.
- **Impact**: High. The tool is currently unusable for its intended purpose.

### 5. **chaos_test** ⚠️
- **Issue**: The tool returns a test plan but does not execute any tests. There is no indication that this is a dry run.
- **Test Command**: `chaos_test(scenario="network_failure")`
- **Actual Result**: A test plan is returned, but no tests are executed.
- **Expected Result**: The tool should either execute the tests and return the results, or have a clear `dry_run` parameter that makes the behavior explicit.
- **Impact**: Medium. The tool is misleading and does not perform its core function.

### 6. **explore_edge_cases** ⚠️
- **Issue**: The tool returns generic edge cases that are not specific to the provided `flow`.
- **Test Command**: `explore_edge_cases(flow="user_registration")`
- **Actual Result**: Generic edge cases about empty usernames and SQL injection.
- **Expected Result**: The tool should return edge cases that are specific to the user registration flow.
- **Impact**: High. The tool is not useful for exploring the edge cases of a specific flow.

## Recommendations

1.  **Implement Input Validation**: All tools must validate their input parameters. For example, `mutate_state` should check for valid entities and actions.
2.  **Verify State Before Action**: Tools that interact with the UI, like `passkey_dialog`, must verify the presence of the expected UI element before attempting to interact with it.
3.  **Return Meaningful Errors**: When validation fails or an expected state is not found, tools must return a clear and descriptive error message.
4.  **Connect to Real Functionality**: Tools like `intelligent_bug_finder`, `discover_invariants`, `chaos_test`, and `explore_edge_cases` need to be connected to their underlying logic to provide real, useful results.
5.  **Use a `dry_run` Parameter**: For tools that can either plan or execute, a `dry_run` parameter should be used to make the behavior explicit.

I am now finished with the testing and have created the report.
