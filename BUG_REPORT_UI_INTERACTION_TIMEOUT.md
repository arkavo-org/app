# Bug Report: UI Interaction Tool Timeout Issues

## Issue Summary
The `mcp__arkavo__ui_interaction` tool is experiencing consistent timeout errors when attempting to interact with UI elements in the Arkavo iOS app, making automated testing impossible.

## Environment
- **Device**: iPhone 16 Pro Simulator (ID: C1AE98D7-6A1A-42D5-87B6-4554056F553A)
- **iOS Version**: 18.5
- **App**: Arkavo (com.arkavo.Arkavo)
- **Date**: 2025-06-06
- **XCUITest**: Successfully set up with target app bundle ID

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Boot iPhone 16 Pro simulator
2. Build and install Arkavo app
3. Set up XCUITest with `mcp__arkavo__setup_xcuitest`
4. Launch Arkavo app
5. Attempt to tap UI elements using `mcp__arkavo__ui_interaction`

## Expected Behavior
- UI elements should be tappable via text-based targets: `{"text": "Get Started"}`
- UI elements should be tappable via coordinate-based targets: `{"x": 196, "y": 680}`
- Actions should complete within reasonable timeout period

## Actual Behavior
All UI interaction attempts result in timeout errors:
```
MCP error -32603: Tool execution error: MCP error: Tool execution timeout
```

## Attempted Actions That Failed
1. Text-based tap on "Get Started" button:
   ```json
   {"action": "tap", "target": {"text": "Get Started"}}
   ```
   
2. Text-based tap on "Continue" button:
   ```json
   {"action": "tap", "target": {"text": "Continue"}}
   ```
   
3. Coordinate-based tap on Continue button:
   ```json
   {"action": "tap", "target": {"x": 196, "y": 1243}}
   ```
   
4. Coordinate-based tap on Get Started button:
   ```json
   {"action": "tap", "target": {"x": 196, "y": 680}}
   ```
   Note: This last attempt reported "Tool ran without output or errors" but the UI didn't advance

## Impact
- Cannot proceed with automated testing of registration flow
- Cannot test biometric authentication sign-in
- Blocks all UI automation testing scenarios

## Additional Context
- XCUITest setup completed successfully and reported text-based interaction capability
- App launches successfully (PID: 34646)
- Screenshot capture works correctly
- The app shows welcome screen with "Get Started" button visible

## Suggested Investigation Areas
1. Check if XCUITest runner is properly connecting to the app
2. Verify timeout duration is sufficient for UI element discovery
3. Check if there are any UI blocking elements or overlays
4. Investigate if the test runner process has proper permissions
5. Review XCUITest bridge implementation for potential issues

## Workaround Attempts
None successful - all UI interaction methods timeout

## Screenshots
- Initial state screenshot saved at: `test_results/initial_state.png`
- Shows welcome screen with visible "Get Started" button
